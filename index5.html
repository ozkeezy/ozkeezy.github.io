				<h2> About The Artist</h2>
			<section class="paragraph">
				<p>

				Growing up I, was always a fan of media and the mash up and mixture of them. Media today is full of references to particular show or movie or song that influenced the creator of media now. This influence and reference is a big part of what I do. I enjoy taking other media and referencing it or sampling it and using it in new ways. I believe that I was able to do that in this class with my projects. Some references may be subtle, otheres may be more obvious but there was always use of other media in my work. </p>
